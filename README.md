# Frontend Mentor - Interactive pricing component

![Design preview for the Interactive pricing component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Description
This is my attempt at [Frontend Mentor's Interactive pricing component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-pricing-component-t0m8PIyY8).

I have not made it interactive as of yet. Right now it's just an HTML, CSS skeleton and I will add the Javascript later on. 
The original solution involves React components which allow for dynamic updating, but in my case I'd probably use jQuery.
